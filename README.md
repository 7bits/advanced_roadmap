advanced_roadmap
================

Redmine plugin written by Emilio González Montaña which add extra funcionality to roadmap. You can find
more information about original plugin in https://redmine.ociotec.com/projects/advanced-roadmap (no need to
repeat http://www.redmine.org/boards/3/topics/31235 ;-) ).

This is a fork to try to get it working with Redmine 2.3.x while [a better approach](http://www.redmine.org/issues/13387)
is provided by [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) itself.
